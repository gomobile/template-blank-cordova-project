  * The "meta viewport" tag (below) helps your app size appropriately to a device's screen.
  * Note that the meta viewport approach is being phased out in favor of the @viewport CSS rule.
  * For a quick overview of both, see this article:

     * "Device-Independent" JavaScript libraries.
    ...
    <style> (or CSS loads) </style>

    <body>
    ...html tags...
     * Intel XDK device JavaScript library.
     * Cordova/PhoneGap device JavaScript library.
     * "Device-Dependent" JavaScript libraries.
     * Application JavaScript <script> tags and libraries.
     * weinre debug script tag for remote console debug.

    JavaScript is being loaded at both ends of the HTML file, in order to coordinate the loading of
    the JavaScript libraries in the webview. You have to wait for the underlying device API native
    code to finish its init, which can take longer than the webview init...

    VERY IMPORTANT: notice that all of the libraries used in this project are located within the app's
    local directories, which means they will get bundled with the app. They are NOT being pulled in
    over the net. In most cases, this is what you should be doing when you build a hybrid mobile app.
    This insures that you always use the JS code that you debugged against AND that you are not requiring
    a data connection (network connection) to get the app started. If your app startup required a data
    connection to initialize and start interaction with the user, lack of a reliable network connection
    coud be disasterous. Not to mention this generally results in a faster load time and is much, much
    friendlier to your end user's data plan and battery.  :-)

    NOTE: do not use a directory prefix with intelxdk.js or cordova.js - they are inserted automatically
    by the build system, emulator and other tools and are assumed to be in the index.html source directory.
    You will not find these JS files anywhere in your project, they are "phantom" libraries. If you do see
    copies of these files as part of your project they should be removed to avoid confusing the XDK.

    When building with any of the XDK "Cordova" build systems (e.g., "Cordova for Android") you can
    omit the "intelxdk.js" and "xhr.js" script files shown below. It does not hurt to keep them, but
    they are not used in that environment, they are only needed for the "legacy XDK" build systems.
    (In the case of the "pure Cordova" build systems, the Cordova and XDK apis are included as plugins
    and the CORS configuration is specified as a parameter in the build configuration file.)

    FINAL VERY IMPORTANT NOTE: If you are using a large number of JavaScript libraries, especially
    third-party libraries (like jQuery, {{ mustache }}, Underscore, etc.) that are "independent" of the
    device APIs provided by the XDK and Cordova libraries and are independent of your application,
    app initialization tends to be most successful if you load these libraries BEFORE the Cordova and
    XDK libraries in the <head> section of your index.html file. Obviously, any libraries that depend
    on the Cordova or XDK library APIs should be loaded AFTER these device libraries.

    Libraries that are "independent" of the device APIs are libraries that you could use in a desktop
    browser in a normal web page or web app. "Dependent" libraries are, most likely, your own code
    that you've written specifically to work with the Cordova or XDK device APIs. In some cases, if
    your device-dependent code requires access to the device-independent code to get started, you may
    have to use something like CommonJS to force the device-dependent code to wait for the device-
    independent code to initialize, otherwise you may have trouble getting your app started.

    Because of this added dependency on the underlying native code (device) initialization, you should
    not use the "document ready" event to start your application. You should wait for the "device ready"
    event before you begin your application (if it uses any device APIs); in practice, it is best to wait
    for both. See the init-dev.js file in this demo app for an example of how to do this.

    NOTE: any library that redefines addEventListener() or fiddles with outstanding events may
    interfere with capturing the "device ready" event and should, therefore, be placed *BEFORE*
    the Cordova and XDK libraries in the load order.
